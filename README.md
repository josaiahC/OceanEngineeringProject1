## Introduction
In this project, depth frequency and speed-of-sound profiles in Winter versus Summer and Day versus Night were considered for various CTD locations in the Cascadia region. Additionally, average speed-of-sound profiles were compared between locations.

Answer these questions:<br>
a. Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs deep profiler.<br>
<p>The Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring (~200m) showed a daily dive count of nine and the Oregon Offshore Cabled Deep Profiler Mooring (~500m) showed dive counts of twelve and thirteen. These two dive counts are not significantly different from each other, which can be explained by the fact that they have relatively similar depths. Both the Oregon Slope Base Profiler and the Axial Base Profiler have a clear pattern of more dives in shallower water. As shown in figures 13,14,17, and 18, nine dives per day were observed with the Oregon Slope Base Shallow Profiler and only up to four dives per day were observed with the Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler. Likewise, figures 21,22,25, and 26 show nine dives per day with the Axial Base Shallow Profiler and three dives per day with the Axial Base Deep Profiler. The Axial Base Deep Profiler tends to travel to over 2500m each dive, so seeing less trips per day than its shallow profiler counterpart (200m) makes sense. The same applies to the Oregon Slope Base Deep profiler: with a maximum depth approaching 3000m, it is only natural that each dive takes longer than the Oregon Slope Base Shallow profiler, which only reaches depths of about 200m.
</p>

b. Where is the maximum value of ssp in each season? Explain why the max ssp should be there?<br>
<p>In the winter, sound speed for all shallow profilers (less than 600m) peaks further from the surface. In the Winter, the water's surface is exposed to cold air, causing temperatures to be cooler at shallower depths and lowering the sound speed. At slightly higher depths, temperature rises again and the sound speed peak occurs. With deep profilers like the Axial Base ones, the maximum sound speed is as deep as the deepest sensor reading; at this point, depth becomes a more significant contributor to sound speed than temperature. Thus, maximum sound speed is seasonally independent for deeper profiles. During the Summer, peak sound speeds are always at or near the water's surface. Sound speed peaks at the water's surface in the Summer because water temperature is greatest from surface warming and surface evaporation raises surface salinity above that of most of the mixing layer. 
</p>

c. Compare the sound speed profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of day vs night).<br>
<p> Eleven out of fourteen sound speed profiles show higher surface sound speeds at night than in the day. In general though, there does not appear to be a significant difference between sound speed profiles at night versus in the day for any profilers. 
</p>
  
  Similar to the changing of the seasons, the speed of sound profile in daytime tends to decrease the depth of the max speed of sound. Additionally, during the daytime thermoclines tend to extend, and as night time arrives they tend to shrink. This effect is more pronounced with shallower profilers than deeper profilers, as fluctuations in temperature are larger toward the water's surface.

d. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of season).<br>
<p>For all profilers except for the Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler and the Axial Base Deep Profiler, the Summer sound speed profile shows a pronounced thermocline with maximum speeds of sound consistently apearing at their shallowest depth readings. Likewise, Winter profiles show increasing sound speed until maxima at depths of 60-80 meters. Notably, sound speed profiles for the Oregon Offshore Cabled Deep Profiler Mooring, Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler, and Axial Base Deep Profiler remain constant between seasons. This pattern with deeper profilers can be explained by sunlight's decreasing effect on water temperature with increasing depth. Light's limited ability to penetrate into water means that after a certain depth, the sound speed profile will not significantly change from Winter to Summer.
</p>

e. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (effect of location).<br>

<p>Both the Axial Base Deep Profiler and the Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler have similar SOFAR depths, remaining centered at a Winter depth of 400m and 500m or at a Summer depth of 600 and 500m, respectively. The Oregon Shelf Surface Piercing Profiler Mooring, Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring, Oregon Slope Base Shallow Profiler, and Axial Base Shallow Profiler show great similarity in the Summer, with maximum speeds of sound between 1488 and 1492 m/s. All shallow profilers' maximum speed of sound increase to 1506-1509 m/s, while the Oregon Shelf Surface Piercing Profiler Mooring and Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring remain at 1484-1488 m/s.</p>
