## Introduction
In this project, Depth vs. Time and Speed of Sound vs. Depth were mapped in Winter and Summer for the following CTD locations:


1.Oregon Shelf Surface Piercing Profiler Mooring<br>
2.Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring<br>
3.Oregon Offshore Cabled Deep Profiler Mooring<br>
4.Oregon Slope Base Shallow Profiler<br>
5.Oregon Slope Base Deep Profiler<br>
6.Axial Base Shallow Profiler<br>
7.Axial Base Deep Profiler<br>

Answer these questions:<br>
a. Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs deep profiler.<br>


b. Where is the maximum value of ssp in each season? Explain why the max ssp should be there?<br>


c. Compare the ssp profile in day and night of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of day vs night).<br>


d. Compare the ssp profile in summer and winter of all profilers, explain what you find (effect of season).<br>


e. Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day in winter and summer (effect of location).<br>
